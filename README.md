# SCSI-Tape-Reader

##Research Proposal
Our research goal is to design a robot that can successfully scan user created dual-channel strips and run programs based on input. After creating the tape reader, we would make many small sub-programs - such as a keyboard controller, a calculator, and a music tracker - as demonstrations of our technology. We hope to explore the intricacies of the process of designing and improving an efficient and intuitive computer interface.

In order to achieve this, we will need to understand and utilize many core principles of robotics, including accurate recognition algorithms for the strips (potentially Hopfield networks), efficient encoding patterns, intuitive user interface design, and reliable mechanical construction. We plan to use a friction based feeder to roll dual channel strips past a head made of two light sensors, allowing the user to input data directly into the machine. After the user selects a task from the screen, he will be able to feed strips to describe the exact parameters of said task using tapes. As a proof of concept, we plan to implement a calculator, a music tracker, and a keyboard/mouse macro engine. Our goal is to make the machine as reliable and user friendly as possible using a novel human interface.
